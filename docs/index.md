Welcome, ludiverbalists! This will be a collection of word games that you can
play in your browser or on mobile. The games, so far

* [Halfabet] - a very divisive word game (first playable version)
* [Quizl] - Battleships / Salvo as a word game (first playable version)

While you're waiting for more games to get added, you might enjoy my old
collection: [Vograbulary]. Josh Wardle's [Wordle] is very popular, have you
tried it? [Codewords] is halfway between a word game and a party game, based on
the Codenames board game.
