Players each hide a five-letter word in their grid, then take turns revealing
each other's letters to find the hidden words. Quizl was designed by
[David Parlett].

## Setup
Type your name and fill the grid with 25 different letters, making one
five-letter word in a row or column. After you've made a word, you may use the
Fill button as a shortcut to randomly place the rest of the letters. Check that
you haven't accidentally made more than one word.

## Play
Randomly choose the player order, and take turns clicking a button to reveal a
space on all the other players' grids.

## Guessing
At any time, you may guess a player's word. Say the player's name, and spell the
word you think is hidden in their grid. **Important:** a word must still have at
least one hidden letter for you to guess it, so think carefully before you
reveal the last letter in a row or column.

## Scoring
If you guess the word correctly, score one point for every space in that grid
that's still hidden. If you guess incorrectly, the word owner scores ten points,
and you skip your next turn.

If you only have ten hidden letters left in your grid, ask the other players if
they want to guess your word, then spell your word if nobody guesses it. Score
ten points if your word is valid, otherwise all the other players score ten
points.

If all five letters of your word are revealed before anyone guesses it, score
one point for every space in your grid that's still hidden.

If you make more than one valid word in your grid, other players can score any
of your valid words. It doesn't matter whether you knew it was a valid word.
